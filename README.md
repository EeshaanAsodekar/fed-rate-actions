This project is about evaluating the Fed's rate decisions in two key rate adjustment cycles.

The aim of the project is to evaluate the Fed's policy rate actions v/s economic indicators corresponding to their mandate, in particular in these two rate hike cycles:
1. Rate hikes during Trump's first term - 2016 to 2019
2. The delayed rate hikes to curb inflatio - 2020 to 2024

We also use the Bloomberg BECO models FOMC sentiment index and a custom economic index and sentiment index to enhance our analysis
